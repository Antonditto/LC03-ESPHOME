## Migration Guide

To use the improved configuration:

1. **Create secrets file**: Copy `secrets.yaml.example` to `secrets.yaml`
2. **Fill in your values**: Update WiFi credentials, passwords, and keys
3. **Backup old config**: Save your current configuration
4. **Deploy new config**: Upload the improved `led-strip.yaml`
5. **Verify operation**: Test all functions and effects

The improved configuration is fully backward-compatible while providing significant enhancements in security, functionality, and user experience.
